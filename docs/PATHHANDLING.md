## Path Logic in Skyscraper

!!! tip inline end "Absolute Paths"

    You may use `~/` at the beginning of the path. This will be replaced with
    the current [home directory](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qdir.html#homePath)
    specific to the OS platform. The notation `~account/some/path` is not
    supported.

This page describes how Skyscraper processes the different paths and especially
how the absolute path is calculated when a you provide a relative path.

Do not get confused by the lenghty flow diagram below. It covers game list folder,
input folder and media folder handling. You wiil notice that input folder and
media folder are almost processed in the same manner.

If you use generate output with Skyscraper for RetroArch as frontend you can
stop reading as Skyscraper expects any of the three parameters input, gamelist
and media folder to be absolute.

Ah, good you made it to the end of the flow.

Pay attention to the connectors _A-A_, _B-B_ and _C-C_ in the diagram.

_Normalization_ means any surplus `./` and `../` are removed from the path.
However, at this stage it is not verified if the filepath does exists. Also, any
symbolic links are not resolved.

Remember the precedence of [CLI and configuration
options](CONFIGINI.md#order-of-precedence) when you read through this document.

Now, let's see how Skyscraper handles relative path configuration options.

### Computing the Absolute Path From a Relative Path

As you can see in the flowchart a few frontends support a relative path for the
input path option. The majority expects in minimum an absolute path as input
folder:

1. Frontends other than Batocera or Pegasus: The input folder must be absolute,
   media and game list path may be relative
2. Frontend RetroArch: Expects absolute paths, also for media and game list
   (called playlists in RetroArch) folder options

The next subsections are summarizing the absolute path calculation Skyscraper
applies for all the different configurable path and file options.

#### By Using Current Working Directory

The current working directory (CWD) is the directory from where you run
Skyscraper. The absolute path is computed as `<CWD>/<parameter-value>` for these
CLI parameters and their values:

`-a <artwork.xml>`  
`-c <configfile>`  
`-g <gamelistfolder>`  
`-d <cachefolder>`

This means the first part of the flow diagram (resolution of Gamelist folder)
also applies to `-a` and `-d` options and their configfile counterparts.

In contrast, when you use one of the three parameters
(`<artwork.xml>`,`<gamelistfolder>` and `<cachefolder>`) in a configuration
INI-file the absolute path it determined from the absolute path of the config
file. See [below](#by-using-an-option-in-a-configuration-ini-file).

#### By Using Skyscraper's Built-in Config Directory

This is usually `/home/<USER>/.skyscraper/` (=_base_). With [XDG](XDG.md) it is
slightly different. The files provided with these options

`--excludeFrom <excludes.txt>`  
`--includeFrom <includes.txt>`

are searched by concatenating the _base_ and for example the exclude file. If
not found, Skyscraper tries to access it with the current working directory as
_base_. If it is not found in any of these locations Skyscraper end with an
error message.

#### By Using the Gamelist Folder

If you define a relative path Gamelist folder either via `-g` or via
`gameListFolder=` (INI-file) and are using a frontend for EmulationStation (or
any other frontend, which is _neither_ Pegasus _nor_ Batocera) then the
configuration for input folder _must_ be provided absolute and cannot be
relative. In turn, the media folder, if it is a relative path, is then assumed
to be relative to the input folder.

However, if you selected the Pegasus or Batocera frontend then the input folder
may be relative. The input folder and media folder, when relative, are then
interpreted by Skyscraper to be relative to the game list folder.

This is also depicted in the diagram above.

#### By Using the Input Folder (ROM-/gamefile-path)

The files provided with these options

`--startAt <ROM-or-game-file-A>`  
`--endAt <ROM-or-game-file-B>`

are first searched in the current working directory. If not found, Skyscraper
tries to access them in the input folder. If they are not found at all
Skyscraper silently assumes that `--startAt` respective `--endAt` are not set.

#### By Using an Option in a Configuration INI File

When you have set one of the four following parameters in the default
configuration file (`/home/<USER>/.skyscraper/config.ini`) or in a custom config
file defined with `-c <configfile>` the path is calculated from the absolute
path of the location of the config INI-file.

```ini
artworkXml=<artwork.xml>
gameListFolder=<gamelistfolder>
cacheFolder=cachefolder>
importFolder=<importfolder>
```

Remember, that the path calculation for the paramters `artworkXml`,
`gameListFolder` and `cacheFolder` differs when using their CLI
counterparts, see [CLI options](#by-using-current-working-directory) above.

!!! note

    The `importFolder=` parameter has no counterpart on the command line.
