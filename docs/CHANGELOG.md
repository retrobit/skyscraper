## Changes

This page summarizes the changes of each Skyscraper release, a [changlog for
humans](https://keepachangelog.com).

### Version 3.20.0 (2026-05-TBA)

- Added: Scraping of TheGamesDB video media. Set `--flags video` or use option
  [`videos=true`](CONFIGINI.md#videos).
- Added: Support for RetroArch compatible frontend output. See
  [frontend](FRONTENDS.md#retroarch) documentation. Thanks to @SineSwiper for
  the valueable input
- Changed: Region prioritization by filename. Before this version any region
  detected in a filename has had the highest priority (put first in the list in
  the order they appear in the filename) for finding a match. Then followed by
  the configured region prios. From this this version onwards the filename
  detected regions are added in order as they appear in the region priorities.
  See also the updated [region
  documentation](REGIONS.md#default-region-prioritization). Thanks for bringing
  this to my attention @mattfeeder18
- Updated: `mamemap.csv` with MAME 0.284 entries and platform definitions of
  Screenscraper.fr, MobyGames and The GamesDB.
- Fixed: Several minor bugs

### Version 3.19.0 (2026-03-16)

- Added: BBC Micro is now supported out-of-the-box as
  [platform](https://github.com/Gemba/skyscraper/blob/23ca6fda9402513df45febe0e21e6041b116b067/peas.json#L369).
  Spin up your BBC emulator, like
  [b-em](https://github.com/FollyMaddy/RetroPie-Share/blob/main/00-scriptmodules-00/emulators/b-em-a5.sh)
  or [libretro
  b2](https://github.com/Gemba/RetroPie-BSides/blob/main/docs/Libretro_bbcmicro.md)
  (since 3.18.4)
- Added: Ability to [disable colored terminal
  output](CLIHELP.md#disable-terminal-colors) by setting the environment
  variable `NO_COLOR=1`. Coloring will now automagically disabled when using
  file redirection of stdout or running Skyscraper via a serial link.
- Added: [JSON
  Schema](https://github.com/Gemba/skyscraper/blob/master/supplementary/scraperdata/peas-schema.json)
  file for platform definition file of Skyscraper and a [Python
  script](https://github.com/Gemba/skyscraper/blob/master/supplementary/scraperdata/peas_validate_with_json_schema.py)
  to validate your `peas_local.json` file against it. _RetroPie users_: Please
  update the skyscraper scriptmodule in the RetroPie-Setup first before updating
  Skyscraper.
- Added: Workaround for ES-DE's potential invalid gamelist: ES-DE places in some
  conditions an `<alternativeEmulator/>` as second root element to a
  `gamelist.xml` file. Any serious XML parser will refuse this file as non
  standard-conformant XML, so did Skyscraper/Qt. Thanks for reporting in the
  first place and testing on macOS @DFelten
- Added: Mitigation of Screenscraper.fr long running responses on some games
  causing games not to be scraped (since 3.18.4), thanks for reporting
  @saitamasahil, @ZacharyFoxx and @therealpxc
- Added: CLI option [`--stderr`](CLIHELP.md#-stderr) which explicitly prints a
  one liner to stderr when Skyscraper runs into an error condition in addition
  to the stdout output. Parsing this single line makes integrations into other
  programs more convenient (leaning towards
  [Scappy](https://github.com/gabrielfvale/scrappy)).
- Added: Build evaluates
  [`SYSCONFDIR`](https://github.com/Gemba/skyscraper/blob/23ca6fda9402513df45febe0e21e6041b116b067/skyscraper.pro#L33)
  environment variable to allow [filesystem hierarchy
  standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard)
  compliant builds and packaging (since 3.18.3). Thanks @Newchair2644.
- Changed: Add ellipsis (...) on truncated text description, when
  [`maxlength`](CONFIGINI.md#maxlength) is reached.
- Changed: Initially implemented logic from 2019 which removes cache files when
  either parameter (m _or_ t) of `--cache purge:m=...,t=...` are matched. Updated
  implementation removes resource if and only if both parameters (m _and_ t) are
  matched, cf. thread in [RetroPie Forum](https://retropie.org.uk/forum/post/306255) (since 3.18.3)
- Changed: More pleasant replacement for colons (:) in texts for Pegasus frontend.
  Now uses the Unicode counterpart (Modifier Letter Colon, 0xa789) (since 3.18.3). Thanks
  @LeeBigelow
- Changed: Changes in The GamesDB API implied some re-write of Skyscraper's TGDB
  scraper module. See paragraphs on changed [API limits and private key
  usage](https://gemba.github.io/skyscraper/SCRAPINGMODULES/#thegamesdb-tgdb)
  (since 3.18.5), thanks to the reporters @rudism, @saitamasahil and
  @BrandonShega!
- Updated: Docker container can now digest a host provided `config.ini` and
  [several improvements](https://github.com/Gemba/skyscraper/pull/221). Kudos to
  @rudism
- Updated: Stricter `--cache` command validation to avoid invalid combinations.
- Updated: ZXInfo scraper now checks first for file hash match, allow overriding
  with query parameter or hinting with release year in parenthesis in filename or
  via `aliasMap.csv` (since 3.18.2)
- Fixed: Some glitches by cache commands which can operate without a platform
  given (since 3.18.4). These cache features were added in 3.15.0.
- Fixed: Reverted logic to ignore media during esgamelist ingest, unless they
  are explicitly set (e.g., `--flags video`) (since 3.18.3); regression from
  3.18.0, cf. thread in [RetroPie
  Forum](https://retropie.org.uk/forum/post/306218), thanks for reporting
  @s1eve-mcdichae1
- Fixed: Filename output name of cache operations (since
  3.18.2), thanks @SineSwiper
- Fixed: A set of edgecase bugs, thanks to all reporters.

### Version 3.18.1 (2025-12-23)

- Updated: File extension `*.m3u` now recognized automatically for all
  platforms/systems, thanks @RandomNinjaAtk
- Updated: On non-Windows OSes the home path is replaced with `~/` for less
  visual clutter in the terminal output
- Fixed: Some games on Screenscraper failed to scrape due to long response times.
  Caused by large response sets to be aggregated on the server (cf. #195),
  thanks for reporting @ZacharyFoxx
- Fixed: Screenshot scraping of scraping module The GamesDB
- Fixed: NixOS build (cf. #194) TL;DR: Use Qt6. Thanks for reporting
  @extjs-fan and @dlip

### Version 3.18.0 (2025-11-23)

Opened [Github Discussions](https://github.com/Gemba/skyscraper/discussions),
the place to put ideas or to table Skyscraper puzzles.

#### Frontends and Scraping

- Added: Support for [Batocera gamelists](FRONTENDS.md#batocera) incl. fanart
  and boxback output, thanks for external testing and feedback, @RandomNinjaAtk.
- Added: Support for fanart and backcover gamelist output for ES-DE and some
  [EmulationStation variants](CONFIGINI.md#gamelistvariants)
- Added: Fanart scraping with Screenscraper-, The Games DB-, IGDB- and
  Import-scraper. See flag and config option [`fanarts`](CLIHELP.md#fanarts)
- Added: Support for ES-DE miximages output (aka Skyscraper artwork) with [`--flag
  miximages`](CLIHELP.md#miximages)
- Added: Scraping of backcover (aka. boxback) from Screenscraper and The Games
  DB and output for Batocera and ES-DE. See flag and config INI option
  [`backcovers`](CLIHELP.md#backcovers)
- Updated: The Games DB scraper for Sega Genesis also tries Sega Megadrive for
  matches, if you made changes to `platforms_idmap.csv`, see [the platform
  doc](PLATFORMS.md#transferring-local-platform-changes) to move it to another
  file, to benefit from this update.
- Fixed: Wrong IGDB token expire time calculation, which resulted in games not
  to be found at their site in some scenarios.

#### CLI and Options

- Added: Option to force Screenscraper scrapes to use the stem of the game
  filename instead of derived parameters. See
  [`--searchstem`](CLIHELP.md#-searchstem-extension) and the last question in
  the [FAQ](FAQ.md). Thanks for contributing, @eilefsen
- Added: Option to list configured extension for a platform. See
  [`--listext`](CLIHELP.md#-listext)
- Added: Allow more relaxed extension syntax in config options (e.g.,
  `addExtensions`). In addition to `'*.ext'` also allow `'.ext'` and even `'ext'`
- Added: Accept also singular for media flags, e.g. `--flags video` additionally
  to `--flags videos`. However, in the config file accept only plural as before.
- Added: Flag [`--buildinfo`](CLIHELP.md#-buildinfo), comes in handy when
  reporting an issue.
- Updated: The prefix "~/" in path-like configuration options will be expanded
  to [QDir:homePath()](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qdir.html#homePath).
- Updated: Option `theInFront` now covers also the indefinite article 'a'.

#### Varia

- Updated: macOS installation instructions to use Qt6
- Updated: Docker uses Ubuntu 24.04 and Qt6
- Updated: Documentation, added usage level for configuration options. See
  [config options
  overview](CONFIGINI.md#index-of-options-with-applicable-sections), plus many
  smaller edits
- Fixed: Various edge cases remediated, esp. #167 and #169, thanks to all
  reporters!


### Version 3.17.0 (2025-05-04)

- Changed: Handling of relative path in configuration options adapted to enable
  that gamelist, ROM folder and media folder can be moved easier around or can
  be moved to other devices. Also, the config INI file can be provided with a
  relative path, as all other path options. See details in the [path handling
  doc](PATHHANDLING.md). Thanks to @cameronhimself for nudging me.
- Added: Artwork finetuning, added option to [control aspect ratio when
  scaling images](ARTWORK.md#aspect-attribute-o_1). Thanks to
  @joyrider3774 for the suggestion.
- Added: More Artwork finetuning, added option to [disable smoothing of
  screenshots](ARTWORK.md#transform-attribute-o) (and other
  images). Thanks to @moritzauge for the idea.
- Added: XML schema file `artwork.xsd` for XML artwork validation, beneficial
  for use in your favorite XML editor.
- Updated: Query keyword `romnom=` in `--query='...'` for scraper Screenscraper
  is now optional. It gets added automagically when no other query keyword is
  applied.
- Updated: `mamemap.csv` for MAME 0.275
- Fixed: (#150) Enable MobyGames scraper usage with personal API key. Thanks,
  @risalt and to the constructive support at MobyGames.
- Fixed: (#122) Updated ZX-Spectrum scraper module. It uses now the site
  `zxinfo.dk` and a web API. The API provides at least the same information as
  the defunct search on `worldofspectrum.org`. Check out the added `--query=`
  options for the [ZXInfo scraper](CLIHELP.md#-query-string). Thanks for the
  hint to @pobulous and to @thomasheckmann for the API access.
- Fixed: (#136) TGDB scraper now tries harder to get wheel/logo mediafiles.
  Thanks for reporting, @joyrider3774.

### Version 3.16.0 (2025-03-10)

- Added: Support for local GameBase DB scraping. See the [module
  description](SCRAPINGMODULES.md#gamebase-db) and [the config
  setting](CONFIGINI.md#gamebasefile) for details. _To the RetroPie users_:
  Please update the scriptmodule in the RetroPie-Setup first before updating
  Skyscraper.
- Added: Documentation on scraper modules supplied with [scraper
  capabilities](SCRAPINGMODULES.md#capabilities-of-scrapers).
- Added: Documentation on options for `--query` parameter per scraper modules.
  See the [recognized query keywords per scraping
  module](SCRAPINGMODULES.md#recognized-keywords-in-query).
- Added: IGDB scraper now supports Screenshot and Cover scraping, plus it
  allows querying with game ID `--query="id=..."`.
- Updated: ArcadeDB scraper now downloads HD video if present, failsafes to
  default video.
- Updated: Tip of the day is now word-wrapped and uses specific paths instead of
  `/home/USER/...`
- Changed: Backward compability limited to Qt 5.11 (Debian Buster), earlier Qt
  versions are no longer supported. However, Skyscraper is fully compatible to
  Qt6 on Linux, macOS and Windows.
- Fixed: Various edge cases.

### Version 3.15.0 (2025-01-24)

- Added: Separate local Platform configuration from upstream Platform
  configuration. Details in the [platform config
  documentation](PLATFORMS.md#transferring-local-platform-changes). _For the
  RetroPie users_: Please update the scriptmodule in the RetroPie-Setup first
  before updating via `retropie_setup.sh`, otherwise you have to install the
  script named in the documentation above manually. Thanks for the nudge,
  @s1eve-mcdichae1.
- Added: Configuration option `gameListFilename`. See
  [documentation](CONFIGINI.md#gamelistfilename), there is also a [command line
  option](CLIHELP.md#-gamelistfilename-filename). Thanks #1, @Leukhos for the
  submission.
- Added: Support "all platform selection" for cache commands within one
  Skyscraper run. See respective documentation for [cache
  report:missing](CLIHELP.md#-cache-reportmissingall-textual-artwork-media-or-resource1resource2),
  [cache validate](CLIHELP.md#-cache-validate), [cache
  vacuum](CLIHELP.md#-cache-vacuum) and [cache
  purge](CLIHELP.md#-cache-purgekeywordmodule-andor-type). Thanks #2, @Leukhos.
- Fixed: Improvements to the Pegasus frontend, to avoid inconsistency with
  existing aliases in the frontend output for the keywords `command/launch` and
  `workdir/cwd`. Thanks, @Leukhos for your third submission.
- Fixed: Some edge case bugs wiped out, thanks to all reporters!

### Version 3.14.0 (2024-12-08)

- Added: Support for [XDG Base Directories](XDG.md), thanks for the suggestion
  @ASHGOLDOFFICIAL.
- Added: Option to allow any delimiter between consecutive brackets and
  parentheses in gamelist title. See
  [`innerBracketsReplace`](CONFIGINI.md#innerbracketsreplace) for examples.
  Thanks for the suggestion, @retrobit.
- Added: Option to retain disc numbering from game filename, when no other
  bracket information is requested. See
  [`keepDiscInfo`](CONFIGINI.md#keepdiscinfo) for details. Thanks, @maxexcloo!
- Added: Option to override year comparison during scraping, if year is present
  in game filename. See
  [`ignoreYearInFilename`](CONFIGINI.md#ignoreyearinfilename).
- Added: [Platform 'Fujitsu
  FM-Towns'](https://github.com/Gemba/skyscraper/pull/95/files). Manually update
  your `peas.json` and `platformid_map.csv` to make use of it.
- Added: Option `--hint`, it shows a random Tip of the Day.
- Updated: Skyscraper's hardcoded `/home/<USER>` replaced with the actual user's
  home directory in messages. Thanks for highlighting it on the Mac,
  @cdaters
- Changed: When an invalid scrape module is provided with `-s` Skyscraper now
  exits. Before this change Skyscraper failed back to cache scraping silently.
- Updated: Check on RetroPie if an existing Skyscraper installation is updated
  at least with RetroPie-Setup 4.8.6 onwards to have the configurable platform
  information deployed (`peas.json`) and provide a remediation to the user, if
  this is violated
- Updated: A downloaded `whdload.xml` file for platform Amiga will be not
  downloaded again until the server indicates. However, manually removing
  `/home/<USER>/.skyscraper/whdload_cached_etag.txt` will force a new download.
- Fixed: Performing Ctrl-C in `--cache edit` mode will now dismiss any changes
  made instead of persisting them
- Fixed: Game rating calculation in Openretro scraping module

### Version 3.13.0 (2024-11-06)

- Added: Option to provide user file `peas_local.json` (same format as
  `peas.json`), to extend platform information or overwrite existing platform
  information
- Updated: `*_platform.json` files as reference for supported platforms of
  various scrapers
- Added: Support for Vircon32 platform in `peas.json`. Thanks for hinting,
  @vircon32
- Removed: `scrapers` entries in `peas.json`, as it did not provide any use.
- Removed: Deprecated flags and options: `includeFiles` superseded by
  `includePattern`; `excludeFiles` superseded by `excludePattern`;
  `gamelistFolder` superseded by `gameListFolder`; `fromfile` superseded by
  `includefrom`. These were deprecated since v3.7.0.

### Version 3.12.0 (2024-07-01)

- Added: Support for scraping of PDF manuals (for scrape modules screenscraper,
  import and esgamelist) and gamelist output with these manuals for frontends
  (ES-DE Frontend and some EmulationStation variants). See configurations
  options [`manuals=true`](CONFIGINI.md#manuals) and
  [`gameListVariants=enable-manuals`](CONFIGINI.md#gamelistvariants). Thanks for
  the initial PR, @pandino
- Added: For frontend ES-DE, evaluate environment variable `ESDE_APPDATA_DIR` if
  present. Thanks for the hint, @ASHGOLDOFFICIAL
- Added: Use also release year as hint on user interaction. This is useful when
  in interactive mode and more than one game with the same name is found.
  Skyscraper can be guided to prefer a specific game when the release year is
  added in parenthesis as part of the ROM name (or alias in `aliasMap.csv`).
  Verbose info in [#59](https://github.com/Gemba/skyscraper/pull/59). Thanks,
  @mjkaye
- Changed: Persistent config option `onlymissing` for counting and scraping only
  games which do not have any game data in the cache. This is a commodity config
  option to the already existing flag with the same name. Plus: If you use a
  scraper with a scraping limit for games to be scraped at once (e.g. MobyGames)
  you may stay below that limit. See also documentation of
  [onlymissing](CONFIGINI.md#onlymissing). Thanks for the suggestion,
  @s1eve-mcdichae1
- Update: Valid extensions (= `formats` in Skyscraper's `peas.json` file) with
  info from RetroPie's `platform.cfg` (commit
  [`5e0ab1f`](https://github.com/RetroPie/RetroPie-Setup/blob/5e0ab1f85994cbb51eb5539d2a7592a3578c15b8/platforms.cfg))
- Fixed: The [update
  script](https://github.com/Gemba/skyscraper/blob/master/update_skyscraper.sh)
  for recent macOS versions. Thanks, @calumbrodie

### Version 3.11.0 (2024-04-15)

- Added: Support for EmulationStation Desktop Edition (ES-DE Frontend). Use
  [`frontend=esde`](CONFIGINI.md#frontend) in `config.ini` and see
  [documentation](FRONTENDS.md#emulationstation-desktop-edition-es-de) on the
  default settings. Thanks for the hints and for testing, @maxexcloo, @Nargash
- Added: Entries in
  [`aliasMap.csv`](https://github.com/Gemba/skyscraper/blob/master/aliasMap.csv)
  are now also applicable for Screenscraper. Thanks, @retrobit.
- Added: Enhanced game name detection for ScummVM platform.
- Changed: In module Screenscraper, in some cases if multiple media types are
  queried (NB: most queries are single-typed), now the first type is selected
  with the first matching region. Only if this does exists in any provided
  region, try the next type with all provided regions (in short: type has
  precedence over region). Previously the regions have been tried to match on
  any media type (=region had precedence over type), which resulted in picking
  the alternative type. This approach gave less suitable media files, especially
  for screenshots (type:`ss`) and screenshot from title screen (type:
  `sstitle`).
- Fixed: Some corner-case bugs fixed, thanks to all reporters!

### Version 3.10.0 (2024-02-10)

- Feature: Preserve existing `<folder/>` nodes in gamelist or create skeleton
  `<folder/>` nodes when ROMs are stored in subfolders within a system folder,
  see [frontend documentation](FRONTENDS.md#metadata-preservation) and the [gamelist
  specification](https://github.com/RetroPie/EmulationStation/blob/master/GAMELISTS.md#folder).
- Feature: [Bash Completion on Linux
  installations](CLIHELP.md#programmable-completion). Use ++tab++ twice for
  completion of Skyscraper options. On RetroPie the scriptmodule will handle
  the installation. On non-RetroPie-Linux put the file
  `supplementary/bash-completion/Skyscraper.bash` into
  `$XDG_DATA_HOME/bash-completion/completions/` (`$XDG_DATA_HOME` is
  equivalent to `$HOME/.local/share`). Open a new bash -- et voila!
- Feature: Customizable installation folder when running `make install`. See
  `PREFIX` in `skyscraper.pro`.
- Feature: Improved macOS support. Unified update script
  `update_skyscraper.sh` (thanks, @jeantichoc) and Docker support via Dev
  Container (kudos, @retrobit).
- Fix: Various minor fixes reported from the community on different setups,
  thanks!

### 2023-12-01 (Version 3.9.2)

- Feature: Import of data in XML format is now more lax (does not rely on
  strict identical indention). Read also the hint in the
  [import scraper module](IMPORT.md#textual-data-definitions-file)
- Feature: Configuration option `tidyDesc` added. See [config
  documentation](CONFIGINI.md#tidydesc)
- Feature: Documentation reviewed and hosted with mkdocs for ease of access at
  https://gemba.github.io/skyscraper
- Update: Added index of configuration parameters to `CONFIGINI.md`. Find
  details at the top of the [config
  documentation](CONFIGINI.md#index-of-options-with-applicable-sections)
- Update: Refactored `skyscraper.cpp` class. Factorised configuration settings
  into `settings.cpp`
- Update: Various other refactorings to remove duplicated code
- Fix: Quit Skyscraper when neither `-p <PLATFORM>` nor `--cache help` nor
  `--flags help` is provided
- Fix: Warning remediated when NULL image was applied in composer/gamebox
  rendering

### 2023-10-22 (Version 3.9.1)

- Feature: Mobygames scraper genres limited to two most relevant genre
  categories ('Basic Genre' and 'Gameplay')
- Update: Removed legacy and unused code
- Update: Code formatting (LLVM)
- Fix: TGDB scraper retrieves screens from `screenshot/` and as well
  `screenshots/` URL path as some platforms (supported since configurable
  platforms) have their screenshots served from `screenshots/`.

### 2023-10-20 (Version 3.9.0)

- Feature: Mobygames scraper respects game id from mobygames.com website via
  `--query=<gameid>`. Handy to hint to the right game information when usual
  search returns false positives.
- Feature: Scrapers which provide an web API (Screenscraper, Mobygames, The
  Games DB (tgdb)) have the full platform information shipped with this release
  (see `<scraper>_platforms.json` files). These files are used as reference.
- Feature: Less 'aliases' maintenance needed in former `platforms.json`.
- Update: Streamlined external platform configuration. File `platforms.json` is
  replaced by `peas.json` (platforms, extensions/formats, aliases and scrapers).
  Precise platform determination for Screenscraper, Mobygames and TGDB via
  `platform_idmap.csv` See [platforms documentation](PLATFORMS.md) for
  details.
- Fix: Failed media download when TGDB provides PNG files instead of JPG files
  and vice versa.
- Update: [Scriptmodule for this Skyscraper](https://github.com/RetroPie/RetroPie-Setup/blob/master/scriptmodules/supplementary/skyscraper.sh) now official part of RetroPie.

### 2023-09-23 (Version 3.8.1.2309)

- Feature: OpenRetro scraper retrieves now also score/rating, if available for a
  game. Precedence is to use reviews from external websites first (right
  header), then the Score label (above the game details). See this
  [example](https://openretro.org/amiga/shadow-of-the-beast)
- Feature: Additionally to the existing import with rating values of 0, 0.5, 1,
  1.5 ... 5 ("Star rating") it is possible to use 0.1 ... 1.0 scale for rating
  in import files (EmulationStation `gamelist.xml` internal rating range). See
  also [import formats](IMPORT.md#resource-formats)
- Fix: Wrong score/rating calculation from Mobygames scraper / Mobygames API.
  See also [this
  gist](https://gist.github.com/Gemba/13f0accddcecd68a356721ebac020d76) on how
  to update your existing Skyscraper `db.xml` files.
- Fix: Use of `--query` free-text search in OpenRetro scraper fixed. This bug
  did not occur when the switch is ommitted and an Amiga WHDLoad file is provided
  to Skyscraper.
- Fix: RetroPie Scriptmodule, removed surplus boolean negation (Thanks
  @s1eve-mcdichae1)
- Fix: RetroPie Scriptmodule, fixed use of legacy option `--unattend` (Thanks
  @windg)
- Update: RetroPie Scriptmodule, relaxed the remove function of the scriptmodule
  to not zap the Skyscraper cache. Plus various cleanups.

### 2023-09-15 (Version 3.8.0.2309)

- updated `mamemap.csv` from MAME 0.240 (Arcade).dat, fbneo.dat,
  mame2003-plus.xml and cleanup of surplus device information
- update script for make `mamemap.csv` does no longer rely on mame binary
- removed discontinued `*.php` scripts
- `platforms.json` sorted and formatted
- updated documentation especially to reflect the supported platforms
- scriptmodule file for RetroPie aligned to their naming convention
- Mobygames platform information refactored from hardwired `mobygames.cpp`.to
  `mobygames.json`
