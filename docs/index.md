### Backstory

This fork is based on commit `654a31b` (2022-10-26) from [Detain's
fork](https://github.com/detain/skyscraper), which was a short-lived fork of
Skyscraper project after Lars retired his project. I started to maintain
Skyscraper in autumn 2023.

Skyscraper focuses on RetroPie integration but it can also be used without
RetroPie. However, the RetroPie-Setup has a
[scriptmodule](https://github.com/RetroPie/RetroPie-Setup/blob/master/scriptmodules/supplementary/skyscraper.sh)
to install this Skyscraper fork.

In essence Skyscraper only relies on a Std-C++17 toolchain and the Qt framework
(Version 5 onwards). The [installation documentation](INSTALLATION.md) will have
your setup covered.
