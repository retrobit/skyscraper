## Overview

Some game information and / or game media is region-based (e.g., release date, artwork). Skyscraper provides several ways of configuring these for your convenience. But most importantly; it supports region auto-detection directly from the file names. Read on for more information about how regions are handled by Skyscraper.

## Scraping modules that support regions

-   Screenscraper (pretty much all game information and media)
-   IGDB (only release date)
-   MobyGames (only cover artwork)

Below follows a general list of supported regions. Not all regions are supported by all modules: The supporting modules are checkmarked for each region.

When configuring regions be sure to use the short-names as shown (eg. 'fr' for France).

### Region auto-detection

Skyscraper will try to auto-detect the region from the file name. It will look for designations in parenthesis such as `(Europe)` or `(e)` or combinations like `(USA, Japan)` and set the region priorities accordingly. This currently works for the following regions and / or countries:

-   asi, au, br, ca, cn
-   de, dk, eu, fr, it
-   jp, kr, nl, se, sp
-   tw, us, wor

So if your files are named like `Game Name (Europe).zip`, there's no need to configure regions manually. Skyscraper will recognize `Europe` and verfifies if it is on the region prios list, unless you disabled the region from filename detection (see configuration option [regionFromFilename](CONFIGINI.md#regionfromfilename)). The default behaviour is:  
- If a detected region is in the region prios list, then the position in the configured region prios matters for finding a scraping match for the game.
- If it is not, the detected region from the filename is added to the end to the region prios list.
- If you set `regionFromFilename` to `"first"`, then every detected region is prepended to the region list in the order they appear in the filename.
Skyscraper will process the region prios list from begin to end and checks the region on the list until it finds one that has data for the requested resource. Do not configure the region prios too narrow, as you might not find a match for every game in your collection then, always put some fail-safes at the end of the list.

### Default Region Prioritization

Skyscraper's default internal region priority list is as follows. Topmost region has highest priority and so forth.

1.   User-specified region set with `--region <REGION>` (command line) or `region="<REGION>"` (config.ini). The `regionPrios=` setting is not applied in this case.
2.   If no user-specified region is set, the [auto-detected](REGIONS.md#region-auto-detection) region(s) will be added at the end of the region prios in the order they appear in the filename, unless a detected region is already in the region prio list. In this case the priority for a region is according to the position in the region prio list. You can also prepend any detected region from the filename first on the region prios list or disable region detection from filename at all. See configuration option [regionFromFilename](CONFIGINI.md#regionfromfilename).
3.   Then this list is processed in order by default: eu, us, ss (Screenscraper specific), uk, wor, jp, au, ame, de, cus (Screenscraper specific), cn, kr, asi, br, sp, fr, gr, it, no, dk, nz, nl, pl, ru, se, tw and ca. If you have configured a region prios list, the list will be processed from left to right.

## Configuring Region Manually

If you insist, of course you can configure the region manually. You can either do this on command-line or through `/home/<USER>/.skyscraper/config.ini`. It is recommended to set it in `config.ini` for a permanent setup.

### config.ini

Read about the [`region`](CONFIGINI.md#region) and [`regionprios`](CONFIGINI.md#regionprios) setting.

### Command line

Read about the [`--region`](CLIHELP.md#-region-code) option.
